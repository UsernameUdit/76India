            The Pokhran II or more referred to as Mission Shakti were a series of five nuclear explosion test carried out by India. It wasn't easy for India to conduct these tests because the US didn't want India to be an atomic power and they would track everything from their satellite and intelligence agencies. The Indian Army tried many technics to cover their operation from the US satellite. These tests were vital because Pakistan started to acquire nuclear weapons and China was helping Pakistan. it might have become a big threat to India in case of any war between two nuclear power that could harm India so a step was to be taken to tackle our enemies. India became a full fledge Nuclear state on 13 May 1998. After the test went public. The USA started condemning India and American Intelligence was badly humiliated due to their failure of stopping India to do nuclear tests.

        <h2>India Missile technology</h2>

        <p>
            India has studied, produced, and used various strategic and tactical missile systems since its independence. Decades-long projects have realized the development of all types of missile systems including ballistic, cruise, anti-ship, air-defense, air-to-air, anti satellite missiles and anti-missile systems. India is one of seven countries in the world with ICBMs and one of four countries with anti-ballistic missile systems. Since 2016, India has been a member of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR). India has made weapons of Mass destruction like Agni-V, Agni-IV Surface-to-air missiles like Akash missile, Trishul, cruise missiles like BrahMos, Nirbhay Anti-tank missiles like Amogha, Nag .A fun fact about BrahMos, It is the fastest cruise missile in the world and it can be launched from any part of the earth land, water, and air. Agni V is an Intercontinental missile the missile has a range of around 5000km to 5500kms. And there are many missiles with many astonishing capabilities. BrahMos mark II (Hypersonic cruise missile) is currently in the development phase.

        <h2>ISRO: The pride of India</h2>

        <p>
            Started in 1969 under Vikram Sarabhai (Indian Space Research Organization) more referred to as ISRO was established to develop an Independent Indian Space Program. The agency launched its first satellite Aryabhata named after the famous Indian astronomer. The satellite was launched with the assistance of the USSR (now Russia) Soviet Kosmos-3M rocket. 
            ISRO had the world record for launching 104 satellites in a rocket in one go with PSLV-C37. ISRO developed its cryogenic Engine technic when the USA denied giving India the technology we see within the GSLV series of heavy-lift rockets. Currently, India has four active operational launch vehicles: Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV), Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mk-III (LVM3) and SSLV(Small satellite launch vehicle).

            The Mars orbiter mission changed the perspective the world saw the Indian space program. MOM was launched on 5 November 2013 and reached the Mars orbit on 24 September 2014 Mangalyaan 1 reached the Mars orbit that no country was not able to do so in its first attempt it made India the first Asian country to reach Mars and the fourth country in the world to do so. This mission planned for six months served for eight whopping years!

            ISRO launched Chandryaaan 3 on 14th July 2023 and as of today I am writing this (12th August) CY-3 is currently orbiting the moon and is set to land on 23rd of August 2023. India might become the first or second nation to land on the South pole of the Moon(Luna-25 Russian moon mission landing is before or the day of landing of cy3)

            ISRO is working on India's first Human space mission Gaganyaan, Aditya L-1 Mission to study the Sun is going to launch in August this year after CY-3 landing on the Moon, NISAR(NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar) is also going to launch this year. ISRO is a cost-efficient space organization in the world it is so cost-efficient that even a Hollywood movie budget is more than ISRO one mission yet for all ISRO has had undoubted success.

            Happy 76th Independence day to everyone! ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³
